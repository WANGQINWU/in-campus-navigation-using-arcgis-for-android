Abstract
Understanding the shortage of current map applications on the application market, people in Wenzhou-Kean University have some additional needs including specific in-campus map and navigation, building information feedback, emergence call, information search and visiting routes. Under this situation, Geography Information System (GIS) is going to use ArcGIS as map service, java as programing language, android as phone operation system, file as database tool to develop and finish project. It is going to help users within navigation, message search tool and more interactions.  GIS is based on Wenzhou-Kean University, and developed for better living in campus.
